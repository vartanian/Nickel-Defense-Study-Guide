    <title>The Coach's Guide to the Nickel Defense</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, single-page dashboard structure was chosen over a linear document format to create a more engaging and explorable "playbook" experience. The user flow is guided by top-level navigation, allowing them to jump directly into core concepts (Intro), the specific position (Nickel Back deep-dive), practical application (Drills), or context (History). This structure facilitates easier learning and reference, as a parent or player can quickly access the section most relevant to their immediate questions (e.g., "What's my run responsibility?") without scrolling through unrelated content. Key interactions, like the Run/Pass toggle, are central to the design, allowing for direct comparison of the Nickel Back's dual roles, which is the most critical concept to grasp. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Base defensive personnel vs. Nickel personnel. -> Goal: Inform. -> Viz/Method: Interactive HTML/JS diagram showing a player substitution. -> Interaction: Button click animates the swap. -> Justification: Visually demonstrates the core concept of the formation change in a simple, memorable way. -> Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Ideal attributes of a Nickel Back. -> Goal: Inform/Organize. -> Viz/Method: Radar chart. -> Interaction: Hover tooltips. -> Justification: A radar chart effectively displays multiple key skill metrics for a single role, showing the "shape" of an ideal player. -> Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Nickel Back's dual responsibilities. -> Goal: Compare. -> Viz/Method: Two interactive content blocks with associated HTML/JS diagrams. -> Interaction: Toggling between "Run Defense" and "Pass Coverage" views. -> Justification: This is the most crucial interactive element. It directly compares the two primary, and very different, jobs of the position, reinforcing the hybrid nature of the role. -> Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Historical rise of the Nickel defense. -> Goal: Show Change. -> Viz/Method: Line chart. -> Interaction: Hover tooltips. -> Justification: A line chart is the clearest way to show a trend over time, emphasizing the formation's growing importance in the modern game. -> Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Player drills. -> Goal: Organize/Inform. -> Viz/Method: Interactive flip cards. -> Interaction: Clicking a card reveals details. -> Justification: Flip cards are an engaging way to present discrete packets of information without cluttering the initial view. -> Library: Vanilla JS/CSS.

            <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-700 mb-12">Alright, listen up. Football is a game of adjustments. The offense is always trying to create mismatches, and our job on defense is to take them away. That's where the Nickel defense comes in. It's not just a formation; it's a philosophy built on speed, versatility, and intelligent football. This guide will break it all down for you. Let's get to work.</p>

            <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">What is the Nickel Defense?</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">It's simple: we trade size for speed. In our base 4-3 defense, we have 4 defensive linemen, 3 linebackers, and 4 defensive backs. When the offense brings in an extra receiver, we need to match their speed. So, we bring in an extra defensive back—the fifth one, hence the name "Nickel." We typically take out a linebacker to do this. Press the button below to see the swap.</p>

            <p class="text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg mb-12">The Nickel Back (NB) is the heart of this defense. This isn't a position for just any corner or safety. He has to be a unique blend of player: tough enough to take on pulling guards in the run game, but agile and fast enough to cover the quickest slot receivers man-to-man. He is a linebacker and a defensive back rolled into one. This chart shows the key attributes that make an elite Nickel Back.</p>

                            <li><strong>Set the Edge:</strong> On outside runs, the Nickel Back is often the "force" player. His job is to attack the ball carrier and force them back inside towards the linebackers and defensive line. He cannot let the runner get outside of him.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fill the Alley:</strong> He must be aggressive in filling running lanes ("alleys") between the tackle and the receivers. This requires courage and proper tackling technique against bigger players.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shed Blocks:</strong> He'll be blocked by tight ends and wide receivers. He must be physical enough to shed those blocks and make a play on the ball.</li>

                            <li><strong>Man Coverage:</strong> Most often, he'll be in man-to-man coverage against the slot receiver, who is usually the quickest player on the offense. This requires elite agility and footwork.</li>
                            <li><strong>Zone Coverage:</strong> In zone schemes, he's typically responsible for the "curl/flat" area, defending against short passes to the sideline and intermediate curl routes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Blitzing:</strong> The Nickel Back is a dangerous blitzer. Coming off the edge, he is often unblocked and can disrupt the quarterback's timing or create sacks and fumbles.</li>
